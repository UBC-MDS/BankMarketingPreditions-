# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction
Authors: Hala Arar, Fazeeia Mohammad, Rong Wan 

## Project Summary
This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on data from marketing campaigns conducted by a portuguese banking institution. Several factors such as client demographics, past interactions, and economic indicators are analyzed to build a predictive model using machine learning and statistical analysis. 

The model will either predict "yes" or "no" for subscription. The analysis leverages the Bank Marketing Campaign Dataset, which includes 16 features, and is implemented using Python with Docker for a reproducible computational environment.
