# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

**Authors**: Hala Arar, Fazeeia Mohammad, Rong Wan 

## Project Summary

This project aims to enhance bank marketing campaigns by using machine learning to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and campaign-related data. The goal is to develop a model that can more effectively target potential customers, improving resource allocation and reducing marketing costs by excluding unlikely subscribers.

The project explores several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. These models are trained on customer data, with preprocessing techniques like feature scaling and one-hot encoding applied to prepare the data for analysis. The outcome of this work demonstrates how banks can leverage machine learning to implement more effective, data-driven marketing strategies, which can lead to better customer acquisition and optimized campaign performance.


## How to Run the Analysis

1. **Clone the repository**

git clone https://github.com/mindy001/Group37DSCI522.git

2. **Set up the environment**

conda env create -f env/environment.yml
conda activate bankenv


3. **Run the Analysis**

After activating the environment, you can run the analysis script or Jupyter notebook called bank_marketing_analysis.ipynb

4. **Open the Report**

The final report is available as a PDF. You can view the completed analysis by opening the bank_marketing_analysis.pdf file.

## DEPENDENCIES

To run the analysis and work with the code, you will need to install the following Python packages. These are automatically included in the environment.yml file, but here is the full list for reference:

altair
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn (includes tools like train_test_split, GridSearchCV, StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder, KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, etc.)
matplotlib
seaborn
ucimlrepo
altair_ally

These dependencies are necessary for data processing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.
